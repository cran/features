Title: Feature Extraction for Discretely-Sampled Functional Data
Description: Discretely-sampled function is first smoothed.  Features
        of the smoothed function are then extracted.  Some of the key
        features include mean value, first and second derivatives,
        critical points (i.e. local maxima and minima), curvature of
        cunction at critical points, wiggliness of the function, noise
        in data, and outliers in data.
